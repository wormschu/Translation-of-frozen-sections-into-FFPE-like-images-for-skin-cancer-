# Translation-of-frozen-sections-into-FFPE-like-images-for-skin-cancer-

This repository provides a description of the generative AI framework used for translating frozen section images into FFPE-like representations for accurate assessment of skin cancer resection margins. The objective of this study is to reduce interpretive variability caused by freezing artifacts and improve diagnostic consistency by generating FFPE-like images in real time during surgery.

The associated manuscript describing the methodology, experimental setup, and validation results is currently under peer review.
